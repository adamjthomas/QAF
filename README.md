# Quality Assurance Framework (QAF)

## Description
This framework is a boilerplate I built to help ease manual quality assurance analysts into automating their tests with code. This framework was heavily inspired and derived from an original framework by [Ahkila Lanka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhila-lanka-b814099a/).

#### Technologies Used:
- Selenium Web Driver
- SqlClient
- HttpClient
- NUnit
- Newtonsoft Json.NET

## Getting Started
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/adamjthomas/QAF.git`
- Open QAF.sln in Visual Studio
- Restore NuGet Packages

## Bugs
Found a bug? If your issue is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/adamjthomas/QAF/issues/new).

## Future Plans
Create a companion web app that will help with learning how to implement this framework to new projects.
